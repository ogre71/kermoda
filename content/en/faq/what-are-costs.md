At Kermoda Counseling Den, we believe in transparency and ensuring our clients are well informed about all aspects of their care, including cost. Here’s a breakdown:

 

1. **Individual Sessions**:

   - **Initial Session**: $180

   - **Subsequent Sessions**: $150 for a 53-minute session (rounded to an hour for convenience).

 

2. **Couples Counseling**:

   - **Initial Session**: $230

   - **Subsequent Sessions**: $200 per hour.

 

3. **Budget-Conscious Options**: While we don’t offer a sliding scale, we understand the importance of accessibility. After the initial session, if cost is a concern, we can discuss shorter session durations to reduce expenses.

 

4. **Insurance**: We do not directly contract insurance providers. However, we do offer the following accommodations:

   - **Health Savings Plans**: We gladly accept payments from health savings plans.

   - **Direct Billing Documentation**: For clients wishing to seek reimbursement from their insurance providers, we can provide the necessary documentation to assist you in directly billing your insurance.

 

5. **Payment**: A payment source must be on file for the convenience and security of our clients and our practice. This ensures smooth transactions and reduces administrative delays.

 

Your well-being is our priority. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions about payment, cost, or insurance matters. We're here to support and guide you.
