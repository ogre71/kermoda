**Why Doesn't Kermoda Counseling Den Contract with Insurance?**

 

We recognize that insurance can play a vital role in healthcare decisions, and it's important for us that our clients understand our decision not to contract directly with insurance providers. Hereâ€™s why:

 

1. **Client Privacy**: By not involving insurance, we can guarantee that your sessions remain entirely confidential. Insurance companies often require clinicians to provide diagnostic codes or treatment plans, which means sharing personal details about your mental health. By bypassing this process, we can ensure the utmost privacy.

 

2. **Treatment Flexibility**: Insurance companies sometimes impose restrictions on the number, duration, or type of sessions they cover. By not contracting with them, we have the autonomy to recommend and provide the type and length of therapy that we believe is truly in your best interest.

 

3. **Reduced Paperwork**: Avoiding insurance paperwork means we can dedicate more time to our clients and less time to administrative tasks. This ensures that our focus remains on providing the best care and support.

 

4. **Direct Client-Therapist Relationship**: We believe in fostering a direct and transparent relationship with our clients, free from third-party interventions. This allows for a therapeutic environment that's built entirely on trust and mutual understanding.

 

We understand the financial considerations that come with therapy, and we strive to offer solutions like accepting health savings plans and providing documentation for clients to bill insurance for reimbursement. Our priority is your well-being, and we're committed to navigating these decisions with your best interests.
